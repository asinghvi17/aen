\title{Petition for Exception}
\author{Anshul Singhvi}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This is a petition for exception from the requirement that a student taking an independent project must be a junior or a senior.  In my case, not only is this project relevant to my study as a 3-2 Physics major, it is also timebound; grant season is fast approaching, as is the April meeting of the NYS American Physical Society, at which this research will be presented.
\end{abstract}

As outlined in the faculty letter to the Committee, this project is not only important and valuable to my course of study on its own, but also serves to gove me some background in electronics.  I did not get in to Digital and Analog Electronics (PHYS 210), which is a required course for my intended Physics major; depending on my schedule at Columbia, it may be impossible to finish the course there, either.

I do apologise for the delay in getting the paperwork filed; we had intended to get it in at the beginning of the semester, but wgot delayed and it fell off the radar.
